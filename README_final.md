# PRINGLE- Program Rendering Interactive Numbers Grapically and Linearly as Expected
## Authors: Christopher Yeh, Taylor-Rain Coleman, Christina De Cesaris



### Introduction: 
This section indicates the purpose of the program and provides background and a justification for why the 
program was created.

This program will be to relate position, velocity, and acceleration graphically as a function of time using initial values input by the user. A graph of each will be produced using the mathematical relationships between the three parameters.

### Program Workflow: 
This section provides an operation overview of what the program does. A flowchart or some other diagram 
might be helpful, but is not required.

This program creates a dataset of 50 ordered pairs using each of the three constant acceleration kinematics equations: a(t)=a, v(t)=at+v, and x(t)=at^2+vt+x. Where a is acceleration and a(t) is the acceleration function, v is initial velocity and v(t) is the velocity function, x is initial position and x(t) is the position function, and t is time. It then uses 

### Dependencies: 
To run a program users may need to have dependencies installed. Indicate which dependencies are required for 
your program.

### Instructions: 
You need to indicate how your program is run.

### Expected Output: 
Describe the files and or directories will be produced by your program.

### References: 
Cite pertinent studies or programs that you used to develop your program(s). For example, cite the source of 
equations, the programs run by your program, the study used to motivate your program etc.
