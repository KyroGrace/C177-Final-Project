# ggplot2 function to custumize graph and produce cleaner outout
# allow for piecewise functions
# in Ui include input drop down for piece wise (with a limit on number of pieces)
# In Server, create conditional statement
# Adjust themes for aesthetics 
#        output$PPlot <- reactivePlot(function() 
#             if Piecewiseoption == true
#                  ggplot two plots (on same graph) over indicated time intervals
#                  use layer function of ggplot to create piece wise graphs?
#             else
#                  plot as normal
# include in graph hover function
# this function is built into ggplot customization
# use xtick, ytick to control and modify tickmarks
# this is to be done more so via trial and error experimentation 
# Guarav's suggestions: add explanations for each equations/between graphs. Overlapping graphs; i.e specific time points w/ acceleration, velocity
# look into shinyapp widgets 
# gganimat, animate changes in graph over time at each point. 
# show physics students to get additional input.
