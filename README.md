# C177-Final-Project

1. PRINGLE- Program Rendering Interactive Numbers Grapically and Linearly as Expected

2. Christopher Yeh, Taylor-Rain Coleman, Christina De Cesaris

3. The purpose of this program will be to relate position, velocity, and 
acceleration graphically as a function of time using initial values input by 
the user. A graph of each will be produced using the mathematical relationships
between the three parameters.

4. Users will need internet to run the Shiny App. If Users wish to expand upon the project, they would need to download R Markdown.

5. Input boxes provide the user options to adjust output on graphs displayed on the side.  

6. Our biggest concern in pursing this project is learning how to code Shiny apps, however, we believe that we are capable of learning enough to achieve this project.
