2. Christopher Yeh, Taylor-Rain Coleman, Christina De Cesaris

3. The purpose of this program will be to relate position, velocity, and 
acceleration graphically as a function of time using initial values input by 
the user. A graph of each will be produced using the mathematical relationships
between the three parameters.
